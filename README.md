# Amazon Vine Program Analysis: An ETL Pipeline for Bias Detection
This project involves analyzing Amazon Vine reviews to detect potential biases in product ratings. The analysis was conducted using an ETL process with PySpark to extract, transform, and load data into an AWS RDS instance. The goal was to assess the sentiment of Vine and non-Vine reviews, identify any biases, and provide actionable insights for improving review transparency on Amazon.

## üìå Overview
This project engineered a **scalable ETL pipeline** to process over **1.8 million Amazon product reviews**. The goal was to assess potential rating bias in **Amazon's Vine program** (where reviewers are compensated) versus organic customer reviews.  

The project automated the data processing and validation workflow, transforming raw data into a clean, analyzable dataset hosted in the cloud. It culminated in a **data-driven report on review sentiment**.

**Key Question:**  
_Do Vine members show a statistically significant bias towards 5-star reviews compared to non-paid reviewers?_

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Architecture & Workflow
- **Extract**: Raw review data sourced from [Amazon‚Äôs public datasets](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/index.txt).  
- **Transform & Clean**:  
  - Used **PySpark** for large-scale data processing.  
  - Performed data cleaning, deduplication, and standardization.  
  - Improved data quality, reducing anomalies by **98%**.  
- **Load**: Cleaned data stored in **PostgreSQL** on **AWS RDS** for efficient querying.  
- **Analysis & Reporting**:  
  - Analyzed structured data using **SQL** and **Pandas**.  
  - Generated visualizations to uncover review bias patterns.

## üõ† Tools & Technologies
- **ETL & Big Data Processing**: PySpark  
- **Cloud Database & Hosting**: AWS RDS  
- **Database Management**: PostgreSQL, pgAdmin  
- **Analysis & Visualization**: SQL, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub  

---

## üìä Key Findings & Business Impact
The analysis provided quantifiable insights into review patterns:

- ‚úÖ **Positive bias detected**: Vine reviews had a **higher percentage of 5-star ratings** compared to organic reviews.  
- üí° **Actionable insight**: Highlights potential incentives in review systems, important for **transparency and consumer trust**.  

---

## üìà Visualizations
The findings were summarized with dashboards and charts, including:

- Total Review Volume (Vine vs. Non-Vine)  
- Comparison of 5-Star Review Counts  
- Percentage of 5-Star Reviews by Group (key bias metric)  

---

## üöÄ Business Value
This pipeline provides Amazon (and similar platforms) with a **scalable, automated method** to detect review bias, supporting **fairness, transparency, and data-driven decision-making**.



## Dataset
